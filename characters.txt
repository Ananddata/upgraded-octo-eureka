Tom Buchanan is a hulking, arrogant bully, born into immense wealth and privilege. He possesses a deeply ingrained sense of 
entitlement and casually displays his social dominance and physical strength. Tom is profoundly insecure despite his outward 
bravado, clinging to a traditional past and resenting the changes he sees in society. His racism and sexism are blatant, and 
his moral compass is skewed by his belief that his status places him above consequence. He is capable of both physical and emotional 
cruelty, as evidenced by his affairs and his brutal treatment of both Daisy and Myrtle.

Daisy Buchanan is a beautiful and enchanting yet deeply flawed woman. S
he embodies the allure of the American Dream, with her charm and sophistication masking a core of shallowness and moral weakness. 
Trapped in a loveless marriage with Tom, she longs for Catsby's romantic idealization but lacks the courage to break free from her 
gilded cage. Daisy is a product of her environment, where wealth and social status are paramount, leading to a careless disregard 
for others and a tendency to prioritize comfort over genuine connection. Her tragic flaw lies in her passivity, allowing events to 
unfold around her rather than taking control of her own destiny.

Nick Carraway is a young Midwesterner who serves as the narrator of the story. 
He is portrayed as an observant and somewhat reserved individual, drawn to the glamour and excitement of West Egg 
while maintaining a sense of moral grounding. Nick is initially captivated by Catsby's charisma and the promise of the 
American Dream, but he gradually becomes disillusioned as he witnesses the destructive consequences of wealth and ambition. 
Throughout the novel, Nick acts as a confidante to both Catsby and Daisy, offering a non-judgmental perspective on their 
tumultuous relationship. His journey reflects the loss of innocence and the growing awareness of the darker realities beneath 
the glittering surface of the Roaring Twenties.

Dick, as a character, does not exist in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel "The Great Catsby." 
It's possible you're thinking of another literary work or perhaps confusing the common phrase "Tom, Dick, and Harry" 
with the characters in the novel.
